## Species are all the types of organisms that exist

## Species is the basic unit of biological classification

*** =left

Rank|Example
----|-------
Kingdom|Animalia
Phylum|Chordata
Class|Mammalia
Order|Primates
Family|Hominidae
Genus|Homo
Species|sapiens

- Genus + species is the `scientific name`
- Usually presented in *italics*
- *Homo sapiens*

## Species knowledge is essential for all biological study

>- **Communication**
  - What organism?
>- **Comparing organisms**
  - Comparing developmental pathways and processes
>- **Understanding evolution**
  - Species relationships, gene and trait evolution
>- **Medicine**
  - Infectious diseases, Vector biology, Zoonoses
>- **Conservation**
  - How many and which species do we conserve?

--- .segue .dark 

## How do we define a species?

--- &vcenter

<q>No one definition (of species) has as yet satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species (Darwin, 1859)</q>

--- .class #id

## Biological species concept (BSC)

<q>Groups of populations that actually or potentially interbreed with each other (Mayr, 1963)</q>

  >- Populations that cannot reproduce are different species
  >- Difficult to actually test for many species
  >- All individuals of uniparental organisms qualify as different species
  >- Generally impossible to apply to fossils
  >- Many examples of gene flow between well established species

--- .class #id

## Many other species concepts

Basis | Name | A species is...
------|------|----------------
Interbreeding | Biological Species Concept | A group of interbreeding natural populations; reproductively isolated from other groups
Genetic or phenotypic cohesion | Genotypic Cluster Species Concept | A morphologically or genetically distinct group of individuals; few intermediates when in contact with other groups
Evolutionary cohesion | Ecological Species Concept | A lineage occupying an adaptive zone minimally different from other lineages; evolves differently from other lineages
Evolutionary cohesion | Evolutionary Species Concept | A lineage of ancestor-descendant populations maintaining identity from other lineages; shared evolutionary tendencies and fate
Evolutionary history | Phylogenetic Species Concept 2 | The smallest monophyletic group of common ancestry
Evolutionary history | Genealogical Species Concept | An exclusive group of organisms all coalescing more recently than outgroup organisms; no exclusive group within

Table adapted from Coyne & Orr (2004), Table 1.1

## Unified species concept

<q>Separately evolving metapopulation lineages</q>

*De Queiroz, K. Syst. Biol. 56.6 (2007): 879-886.*

  >- Separates species concepts and species evidence
  >- Things like reproductive isolation are a consequence of separate evolution
  >- They are ways of identifying species, not a requirement for species

## Who decides which species are different?

## Taxonomy: the science of naming species

  >- Taxonomists gather data from natural populations
  >- Traditionally this would be morphological data
  >- Distinct categories suggest separately evolving groups
  >- Complicated by:
    + geographic and ontogenetic variation, sexual dimorphism and phenotypic plasticity
  >- Modern taxonomy seeks additional lines of evidence: 
    + genetics, behaviour, ecology
  >- Sometimes this reveal `cryptic species`, which lack clear morphological separation

## What keeps species separate?

--- .class #id

## Barriers to reproduction

- Some barrier must exist that stops individuals of different species from (frequently) reproducing
- Otherwise, 2 species would fuse into 1 species when they come into contact
- We classify these barriers as `prezygotic` or `postzygotic`
- `Prezygotic` barriers prevent fertilisation, and can be pre- or post-mating
- `Postzygotic` barriers prevent hybrid offspring from reproducing

--- .class #id

## Prezygotic barriers can be:

- Ecological
- Temporal
- Behavioural
- Mechanical
- Gamete incompatibility
- and more...

--- &twocol

## How do species originate?

--- .class #id

## Modes of speciation

>- A single species diverges in two (or more) descendant species
- This is called `speciation`
- Thought to generally take a long time
- But examples of rapid speciation exist
- We recognise 2 major categories:
  + `Geographic`: involving spatial separation
  + `Sympatric`: occurring in a single location

--- .class #id

## Geographic speciation

>- Several subcategories are recognised:
- `Allopatric` speciation involving complete geographic isolation
  + Can be termed `vicariance` when the descendant populations are large
  + Or `peripatry` when a small subpopulation is isolated
- `Parapatric` speciation involves geographically adjacent with a contact zone

--- .class #id

## Allopatric speciation: vicariance

- Glacial climates caused vicariance in Europe
- Isolation of temperate species in southern refugia
- Promoted allopatric speciation
- E.g. grass snakes, *Natrix helvetica* (western) and *Natrix natrix* (eastern)

```{r, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("./assets/img/natrix_LGM_montage.png")
```
*LGM map, Ulamm, CC BY-SA 3.0*

--- .class #id

## Allopatric speciation: peripatry

- Many examples along island archipelagos: overseas dispersal and colonisation
- E.g. *Anolis* lizards of the Lesser Antilles

```{r, out.width = "70%", dpi = 300, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("./assets/img/LA_anoles_montage.png")
```

--- &twocol

## Parapatric speciation

- involves geographically adjacent populations
- Can result in `ring species`, e.g. *Larus* gulls: 1. L. fuscus, 2.Siberian L. fuscus, 3. L. heuglini, 4. L. vegae birulai, 5. L. vegae, 6. L. smithsonianus, 7 L. argentatus

```

--- .class #id

## Sympatric speciation

>- A single species diverges into two without a geographic barrier
- Historically controversial, but several examples are now known
- Typically thought to result from `disruptive selection`
  + selection favours extreme phenotypes
  + for example due to ecological niche divergence
  + can be reinforced by reproductive barriers, for e.g. sexual selection

--- .class bg:white

## Disruptive selection

- Selection favours extreme phenotypes
- Produces distinct phenotypic categories, or ecotypes
- Preferential mating within ecotypes can lead to sympatric speciation

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df1 <- enframe(rnorm(750, 10, 3))
df2 <- enframe(rnorm(500, 5, 2))
df3 <- enframe(rnorm(500, 15, 2))

df1$distribution <- "d1"
df2$distribution <- "d2"
df3$distribution <- "d2"

two_dist <- rbind(df1, df2, df3)

plot <- ggplot(two_dist) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = value), binwidth = 1, colour = "black", fill = "coral") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank()) +
  labs(x="Phenotypic trait", y="fitness")
```

```{r, out.width = "90%", out.height = "80%", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5, dpi = 600, echo = FALSE}
anim <- plot +
  transition_states(distribution, 
    transition_length = 1,
